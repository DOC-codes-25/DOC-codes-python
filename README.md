# DOC-codes-python
My python learning journey and coding exercise.
This repository serves as the public log and portfolio for my journey mastering Python 3 fundamentals. My aim is to build a strong programming foundation to eventually pursue opportunities in data analysis and digital health technology.

### Current Learning Focus

I am currently focusing on the core building blocks of the Python language:

* **Data Types:** Understanding and manipulating `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`.
* **Data Structures:** Introduction to `lists`, `tuples`, and `dictionaries`.
* **Control Flow:** Mastering conditional statements (`if/elif/else`) and iteration (`for` and `while` loops).
* **NumPy Basics:** Learning how to create and manipulate 1D and 2D arrays.

### Future Goals

Once the fundamentals are solid, I plan to move on to:

1.  Creating and utilizing custom functions.
2.  Building small, focused projects (e.g., a simple command-line game).
3.  Exploring libraries like **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** for data visualization.

### Environment

All code in this repository is currently written and tested on my **Android device** using the **Pydroid 3 IDE**.
